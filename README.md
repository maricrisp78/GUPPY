1.       Responsive Landing Page Design
We have a new advertiser, who wants us to distribute their Chrome plugin, called, Ultimate Sport.  You can take a look at their offering at the following link. You will have to use Chrome to see it:
 
http://www.ultimatesports.info/index.html?extid=fekhlhijaafdglmfilmikiojcogellde&extname=UltimateSport&gid=EX1000165&tracking=&WebInlineVersion=1.1.0.8&SID=3cb89baf-ca33-d77e-8577-f0009bb1379d&LogoUrl=http://www.ultimatesocial.org/images/mybrand_logo.png&SoftwarName=%20&AccID=A-559705&lang=en&thankYouPageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fa.gmtrack.com%2Fpixel.track%3FAdvertiser%3DPERION%26ClickID%3D&ShowWelcomePage=yes
 
 
In order to start distributing this product,  we will need to create a landing page for users to take an action. The sample landing page is as follows:
http://seen-on-screen.thewhizmarketing.com
 
Can you create a landing page for Ultimate Sports and  link them with the above URL so that it will install upon click on an action button?
I also want you to make it optimize for iphone and iPad. In this case, the above extension will not work and you will need to generate a error message saying that this extension is not supported for your device.
Once you completes the task, please host it on one of your server and let me know the URL.
 
 
2.      Banner design
Before launching this project, we will need to create a standard set of banners. Please create banner with the following sizes in JPG:
 
468x60, 234x60, 120x240, 125x125, 160x600, 300x250, 180x150
 
 
You can put them in ZIP file and upload to your server of choice.
